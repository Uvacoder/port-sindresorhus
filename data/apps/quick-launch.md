#### The widget does not show up in the widget picker

This is a well known iOS 16 issue. [Try this.](https://webtrickz.com/third-party-lock-screen-widgets-not-showing-ios-16/)

#### Can the Lock Screen widgets be full-colored?

This is unfortunately not possible. iOS enforces that Lock Screen widgets are single-colored.

#### Can you support more actions when tapping a widget?

Sure. I'm happy to consider requests. [Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Quick%20Launch&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### When using the “Run Shortcut” action, why does tapping the widget first open the main app and then the Shortcuts app?

This is because of iOS limitations. A widget can only open its own app when a user taps it. And the only way to run a shortcut is to open the Shortcuts app using a special URL. So when you tap the widget, the widget opens the main app, and the main app then opens the Shortcuts app. It's not a very good user-experience, but only Apple can fix this.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. I earn money on other apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### Where can I find the changelog?
