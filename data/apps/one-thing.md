This can be a useful tool to help you focus on a single task.

Some examples of what you could write:

- Eat more healthily
- Exercise
- Reply to Sarah's email
- Be happy
- Stop procrastinating
- Finish the ü¶Ñ project
- Important meeting today

However, what you use this space for is really up to you.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=One%20Thing&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The menu bar item has disappeared!

macOS hides menu bar items that do not fit. [Click here](one-thing:?text=) to reset the text.

#### I made the text too long and now the menu bar item is hidden

[Click here](one-thing:?text=) to reset the text.

#### Can I have execute an action when I click the text?

You can add a [link using Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links).

#### What if I have two things?

The point is to focus on one thing at a time. [Humans work best this way.](https://dariusforoux.com/one-thing/) However, nothing is stopping you from writing two things, for example, with a `¬∑` character in-between.

#### Can I have two instances of One Thing running at the same time?

I have made a special version of One Thing with a different identifier. You can run this together with the App Store version. It also has a separate URL scheme: `one-thing2:`. This version will not receive updates.

#### How can I show the next task in the ‚ÄúToday‚Äù list in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) in One Thing?

You can use the macOS Shortcuts app for this. Things unfortunately does not have very good Shortcuts support ([Please tell them to improve that!](https://culturedcode.com/contact/)), so we have to resort to AppleScript to fetch the next task in the ‚ÄúToday‚Äù list. Here's an [example shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/62c0f5fc4d194b72a6f97ce8cedf698f).

Shortcuts does not yet support automation, so to have the shown todo stay in sync with Things, we need to use the [Shortery](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortery/id1594183810) app to run the shortcut. Choose the ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù trigger type and make it trigger when Things becomes ‚ÄúInactive‚Äù. Alternatively, place the shortcut in the menu bar and run it manually.

#### How can I show a todo from my favorite todo app in One Thing?

Do something similar to the above answer.

#### How can I put spacing on the sides of the text?

You can add some horizontal padding around the text by adding multiple spaces to the ‚ÄúPrefix‚Äù and ‚ÄúSuffix‚Äù settings.

#### Can you add iOS / watchOS support?

I plan to do it if the app takes off. So tell your friends.

#### How can I export, import, sync, or backup the settings?

[See this guide.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/main/backup-app-settings.md)

#### Is the app native?

Yes, it's native and written in Swift and SwiftUI.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making Mac apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1604176982) and click ‚ÄúVersion History‚Äù.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't have any immediate plans to localize the app.

For example, in your terminal:

open --background 'one-thing:?text=Exercise'
```
