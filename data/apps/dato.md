Dato gives you a local clock, date, and multiple world clocks in the menu bar. When you click Dato in the menu bar, you get a menu with a calendar, calendar events, and world clocks. All of this is highly customizable.

Dato is a one-time purchase with free upgrades forever. Dato will never be subscription-based.

Dato supports all the locales and languages that macOS supports for the menu bar text, dates, times, and the calendar, but the menus and settings are English-only.

[MacStories review of Dato.](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/dato-review-calendar-events-and-time-zones-from-your-macs-menu-bar/)

Dato requires macOS 12.4 or later.

### Trial

There's a fully functional trial available [here](https://dsc.cloud/sindresorhus/Dato-4.3.0-trial-1668009725). The only limitation is that it will prompt to buy Dato every 12 hours and it will not receive updates. If you decide to buy Dato on the App Store, all data and settings from the trial version will be preserved (they share the same storage).

### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Dato&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender if you have it installed.

#### How can I open meeting links (Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.) in a specific browser?

Check out my free [Velja app](https://sindresorhus.com/velja). It has built-in support for this without any setup. It can even open links to Zoom and Microsoft Teams directly in their desktop app.

#### How can I hide the built-in menu bar clock on macOS 11 or later? {#macos11-hide-clock}

It's unfortunately no longer possible to disable the built-in menu bar clock.

However, you have some options:
1. **(Recommended)** In “System Settings › Control Center › Clock Options”, choose the analog clock and disable showing the date. This gets you the closest to how it was on macOS 10.15 as you can use Dato for both date and time. <img width="258" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/170270/105505537-a5044800-5cfb-11eb-979b-7a0b109f0c93.png"><br>This has the added benefit that while the system clock [shows as disabled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/170270/105506021-2c51bb80-5cfc-11eb-84a6-79b62d69d4bc.png) when you enable “Do Not Disturb” (which makes it pretty unreadable), Dato always shows it the same way.
2. Use Dato for showing the date and the built-in clock for the time.
3. Only show an icon for Dato.

I would really appreciate it if you could take a moment to [complain to Apple](https://www.apple.com/feedback/macos.html) that they should bring back the ability to disable the built-in menu bar clock. For reference, on macOS 10.15, there's a checkbox called “Show date and time in the menu bar” in “System Preferences › Date & Time › Clock”. This checkbox no longer exists on macOS 11 and later.

I have already [reported it to Apple](https://github.com/feedback-assistant/reports/issues/131), but I have yet to get a reply.

#### How can I add multiple time zones to the menu bar? {#time-zones-menu-bar}

In the Dato settings, go to the “Time Zones” pane, add a time zone, and in the edit window, check “Show in menu bar”. Do the same with the other time zones you want to show in the menu bar. If you already have the time zones added, right-click a time zone, click “Edit”, and then check “Show in menu bar”.

#### How can I toggle AM/PM for the time?

Dato adheres to what you have set in “System Settings › General › Language and Region”.

#### How can I change the first day of the week?

Dato adheres to what you have set in “System Settings › General › Language and Region”.

#### Can you integrate with Cron?

The integration is already done, but Cron has a multiple bugs that makes it not work properly. We will have to wait for Cron to fix these bugs.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

All the date and time output and the calendar adhere to your locale settings. I have no plans to localize the app itself.

#### I added a calendar to the Calendar app but it doesn't show up in the app

You need to enable the calendar in the Dato settings.

#### Can you add support for Google Calendar / Outlook 365 / Exchange?

It's already supported. Just add your calendars to the built-in Calendar app and then enable those calendars in the app settings.

#### How can I customize the menu bar date and time format?

If you just want to toggle a certain component, like date or time, see the “Menu Bar” pane in the Dato settings.

If you want something more custom, go to “Date & Time Format” text field. You can specify a [datetime pattern](https://nsdateformatter.com).

For example, you could display the full month name, the year, or the day of the year.

#### How can I show the menu bar date and time in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format?

Either change [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340) or go to the “Menu Bar” pane in the Dato settings, and in the “Date & Time Format” text field, write `YYYY-MM-DD  hh:mm:ss`.

#### Why is Dato not showing week 53?

You are probably expecting [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) while having your system set to [Gregorian week numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar). You can change it with [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340).

#### Why is Dato showing the last days of December as week 1?

That is called [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).

#### Dato is showing the incorrect week number

You are probably expecting [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) while having your system set to [Gregorian week numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar), or the inverse. You can change it with [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340).

#### How can I change the week number to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) format?

Change [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340).

#### How can I open a calendar event in my favorite calendar app (Fantastical, BusyCal, etc.) instead of the built-in Calendar app?

Dato uses the system default calendar app. To change the default calendar app, open the Calendar app's settings, and in the “Default calendar app” setting, select the app you want.

Dato supports opening calendar events directly in Calendar, Fantastical, BusyCal, Outlook, and Google Calendar (web). For other apps, Dato will just open the app.

**Note:** If the above instructions don't work, it means [this macOS bug](https://github.com/feedback-assistant/reports/issues/290) is still not resolved. The bug makes the default calendar setting not work. To work around this, drag an event from the Calendar app into Finder, right-click on it, select “Get Info”, select your calendar in the “Open with” field, and click “Change All”.

#### How can I make my calendar refresh more often?

Open the Calendar app's settings, go to the “Accounts” pane, choose the relevant calendar service in the left sidebar, and then change the “Refresh Calendars” preference. Ideally, it should be set to “Push”, but not all services support that, like Google.

#### How can I get notifications for upcoming events? {#notifications}

Dato does not support this as you can just set it up in the built-in Calendar app. Open the Calendar app's settings, select the “Alerts” pane, and there you can choose when to be notified.

What Dato does support is showing a notification right when an event for a video call (Zoom/Meet/Teams) starts. The notification includes a button to join the video call directly. You can enable this notification in the Dato settings.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1470584107) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you add support for showing an analog clock like the system clock?

I have no plans to add that, but you can make it work by unchecking the “Time” preference in Dato and keep the system clock in analog mode.

#### Can you add support for flashing the time separator like the system clock?

I have no plans to add that, but you can make it work by unchecking the “Time” preference in Dato and keep the system clock.

#### A calendar is missing

First, ensure that you have added the calendar to the system. Open the Calendar app's settings, click the “Accounts” pane, and then check that the calendar is there. Dato can only show calendars added there.

If it exists in the Calendar app, open the Dato settings, click the “Events” tab, and make sure the calendar is enabled.

If it exists in the Calendar app but not in Dato, macOS might have corrupted some permissions. This is, unfortunately, a common problem. Try to reset the permissions for Dato. Quit Dato, open the Terminal app, and paste in the following command and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

```sh
tccutil reset All com.sindresorhus.Dato
```

Then launch Dato again.

#### Is it possible to pin Dato so it's always visible?

This is unfortunately not possible as Dato uses a menu, not a popover, which cannot be pinned.

#### How can I make the text in Dato be more easily readable?

Try turning off the “Vibrancy” setting. You can also try increasing the text size with the “Larger text” setting.

#### My Google Calendar does not update in the app

You might have to re-authenticate your Google account. Open the Calendar app's settings, go to the “Accounts” pane, and try to remove and re-add the Google account.

#### Can I show UTC time in the menu bar?

Yes

1. Open the Dato settings
1. Go to the “Time Zones” pane
1. Click the plus button
1. Write “utc”
1. Select the “UTC” item
1. Click “Add”
1. Enable “Show in menu bar”
1. Click “Save”

#### How can I copy a link from the event notes? I need to open it in a specific browser profile.

If it's a non-clickable URL (not a link), you can select the URL and choose “Copy Selected Text”. Otherwise, activate the correct browser profile and then drag and drop the link into the browser window.

Alternatively, you could use a browser picker like [Velja](https://sindresorhus.com/velja) to handle this for you.

#### How can I hide the Dato clock when doing a specific task or at a certain time of the day?

This is a perfect use-case for the built-in Shortcuts app. You can use the `Quit App` and `Open App` actions to quit and relaunch Dato whenever needed. For example, you could create a focus shortcut that quits Dato, plays some music, turns off notifications, etc.

To hide the Dato clock at certain time of the day, you need the [Shortery app](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/shortery/id1594183810?mt=12). The Shortery app is only a temporary requirement. It's almost certain that Apple will introduce automation for Shortcuts in macOS 13.

#### Can I change the background color of Dato?

No, but you can make it white/black by turning off the “Vibrancy” setting.

#### How can I export, import, sync, or backup the settings?

[See this guide.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/main/backup-app-settings.md)

#### How is this different from Fantastical?

Fantastical is a full-blown calendar app, while Dato is a read-only view of your events. Fantastical is a replacement for the built-in Calendar app. You can use both Fantastical and Dato at the same time. Dato even has integration with Fantastical, so you can open events in Dato directly in Fantastical. Fantastical also has a menu bar item, but many people prefer the UI of Dato. Dato also shows time zones and has more customizability for what's shown in the menu bar. Dato can replace the system date/time, for example.

#### How is this different from iStat Menus?

iStat Menus lets you show different kinds of info in the menu bar, like system stats, network speed, etc. Dato is focused on date and time only. Dato also looks better.

#### How is it different from Itsycal?

Dato is not just a calendar app, but also includes menu bar clock replacement, time zones, upcoming event in menu bar, and more. Try both (see the Dato trial) and see for yourself.

#### Why the name “Dato”?

It means “date” in Norwegian. I just wanted a short, unique, and relevant name.

#### Do you plan to open-source it?

I open-source [most things](https://github.com/sindresorhus) I make, but I don’t intend to open-source this app. Many open-source apps have problems with someone using the source to [publish clones](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/1202144430477627394) and it’s a hassle to get Apple to take down such clones. I also have my own private framework that makes it faster for me to build apps, but I don’t want to open-source it as then I would have to maintain it.
