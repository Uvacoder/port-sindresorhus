The perfect companion to the built-in Calendar app. Just the events for today. Click an event to show it in the Calendar app. It also gives you a quick way to directly join an upcoming video call.

This app is intentionally simple. For more advanced needs, check out [Dato](/dato).

It integrates with Calendar, Fantastical, and BusyCal.

*Requires macOS 13 or later.*

### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Today&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender if you have it installed.

#### How can I open meeting links (Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.) in a specific browser?

Check out my free [Velja app](https://sindresorhus.com/velja). It has built-in support for this without any setup. It can even open links to Zoom and Microsoft Teams directly in their desktop app.

#### I have Fantastical set as my default calendar app but Today still opens Calendar

There is a [macOS bug](https://github.com/feedback-assistant/reports/issues/290) which makes the default calendar app setting not work. To work around this, drag an event from the Calendar app into Finder, right-click on it, select ‚ÄúGet Info‚Äù, select your calendar in the ‚ÄúOpen with‚Äù field, and click ‚ÄúChange All‚Äù.

#### Can you add x feature?

This app is a personal experiment to make the simplest calendar app possible. I'm happy to consider requests, but I'm also trying to hard keep the app simple.

#### Can the app show notifications for events? {#notifications}

You can set up notifications for events in the Calendar app.

#### Can the app show notifications with a ‚ÄúJoin‚Äù button for video calls?

I don't plan to add this. You can get this feature in my [Dato app](/dato).

#### Can the app show the upcoming event in the menu bar?

I don't plan to add this. You can get this feature in my [Dato app](/dato) (with a lot of customizability).

#### Can you make the app show events for more days?

‚ÄúToday‚Äù üòÅ

#### Can you add more menu bar icons?

I'm happy to consider requests. You can find icons [here](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/).

#### I added a calendar to the Calendar app but it doesn't show up in the app

You need to enable the calendar in the app settings.

#### Can you add support for Google Calendar / Outlook 365 / Exchange?

It's already supported. Just add your calendars to the built-in Calendar app and then enable those calendars in the app settings.

#### My Google Calendar does not update in the app

You might have to re-authenticate your Google account. Open the Calendar app's settings, go to the ‚ÄúAccounts‚Äù pane, and try to remove and re-add the Google account.

#### Can you add some widgets?

I don't plan to add this. Very few users actually use widgets on macOS, so it's not worth the effort for a free app. macOS already has some built-in calendar widgets. And you can get more widgets with my [Dato app](/dato).

#### Can you support iOS?

I plan to do that at some point when the app is more mature.

#### How does it compare to MeetingBar? {#meetingbar}

MeetingBar is mainly for video calls and has a gadzillion settings and features around that. Today has a cleaner look and is opinionated so you don't have to make so many choices. If all you need is a quick way to join video calls, Today is probably what you want. If you need more advanced features, MeetingBar or [Dato](/dato) may be a better choice.

#### How does it compare to Meeter? {#meeter}

Meeter is mainly for video calls. It's also quite buggy and does not follow macOS conventions. Today has a cleaner look and is opinionated so you don't have to make so many choices. If all you need is a quick way to join video calls, Today is probably what you want. If you need more advanced features, MeetingBar or [Dato](/dato) may be a better choice.

#### How can I export, import, sync, or backup the settings?

[See this guide.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/main/backup-app-settings.md)

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't have any immediate plans to localize the app.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6443714928) and click ‚ÄúVersion History‚Äù.
