#### Why not just use Photo Booth?

This app has some benefits:

- Higher quality camera output.
- Does not crop the camera output.
- Takes photos without the countdown.
- Photos are saved to the file system, not hidden inside the app.
- The window can be made to always stay on top of other windows (useful for presentations).
- The window can resized to be smaller.
- The window can be made borderless.
- Made by an indie developer that listens to users.

#### Can you make it available in the menu bar?

I plan to make a separate app for that.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making Mac apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### Where can I find the changelog?

Go [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1632827132) and click “Version History”.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't have any immediate plans to localize the app.
